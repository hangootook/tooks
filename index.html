<p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS <u>Derek</u> Chauvin</strong> was found guilty of murder in the death of George Floyd, a Black man whose death last May in police custody was captured on video that went viral and set off a summer of unrest over law enforcement treatment of people of color.</p>
<p>I hope it will change some things. Im praying its a steppingstone, said Christin Hickman, a 35-year-old from Minneapolis. But it didnt change with Emmett Till. It didnt change with Rodney King. So, you know, Im not holding my breath.

</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Mr. Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted of all counts in the death of Mr. Floyd, which inspired nationwide protests and debate after it was captured by bystanders on video.</p><p> Like the 1995 O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Rodney King police-brutality case in 1992, the three-week Chauvin trial was closely watched and viewed by many Americans as a watershed moment in U.S. race relations, even hearkening to Emmett Till, a Black teenager who was murdered in Mississippi for purportedly offending a white woman in the 1950s. That episode, and the lack of accountability for the killers, helped galvanize the civil-rights movement.</p>
